        <h1>Environmental Pollution: Causes and Awareness</h1>
        <p>The environment is our shared home, comprising air, water, land, and ecosystems. However, the delicate balance of this habitat is under threat due to pollution. Let's explore the causes of environmental pollution and raise awareness about its impact.</p>
        <h2>Causes of Environmental Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Smoke from factory chimneys and vehicle exhausts. Harmful gases include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Improperly treated industrial waste and sewage. Consequences include contaminated water bodies and loss of aquatic biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil or Land Pollution:</strong> Causes include deposition of solid waste and accumulation of non-biodegradable materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Awareness and Action</h2>
        <ul class="action-list">
            <li>Education: Raise awareness through schools, colleges, and community programs. Teach responsible waste management and eco-friendly practices.</li>
            <li>Individual Responsibility:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce, reuse, and recycle.</li>
                    <li>Avoid single-use plastics.</li>
                    <li>Plant trees and participate in clean-up drives.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Government Policies: Strict enforcement of pollution control laws. Promote sustainable practices in industries.</li>
            <li>Global Cooperation: Collaborate across borders to combat pollution. Address climate change collectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, each of us plays a vital role in preserving our environment. Let's act now for a cleaner, healthier planet! üåçüå±</p>
